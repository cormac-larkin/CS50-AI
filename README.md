# CS50-AI - Introduction



CS50 AI is Harvard University's 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python'. This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.  The course consists of 7 weeks of material. Each week consists of a ~2hr lecture and 2 homework assignments. Below is an overview of each week's assignments and the links to my solutions.

# Week 0: Search

## Key Concepts

  * Depth-First Search
  * Breadth First Search
  * Heuristic Functions
  * MiniMax Algorithm
  * Alpha Beta Pruning

### Problem Set Part 1: Degrees
Implement a Breadth-First Search Algorithm to find the degrees of separation between two selected actors, by films they have starred in.

### Problem Set Part 2: Tic-Tac-Toe
Implement an AI which utilises the MiniMax algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe. This AI should be unbeatable. A human player can draw with the AI if they play optimally, but may never beat it.

# Week 1: Knowledge

## Key Concepts

  * Propositional Logic
  * Inference
  * Knowledge Engineering
  * Model Checking
  * First Order Logic

### Problem Set Part 1: Knights
Solve 'Knights and Knaves' logic puzzles using propositional logic and model checking.

### Problem Set Part 2: Minesweeper
An AI which plays Minesweeper. This AI stores information about the game state in a knowledge base, and makes inferences to decide which move to make next.
